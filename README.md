<h3 align="left">Division:</h3>

- **Distributed Consider EKF for a 4 Cubesat Formation w/ Deputies having Relative Range Meas. and a Chief with GPS Meas. - Includes Dynamics with Gravity,J2 Perturbations and Spacecraft Drag with an Exponential Atmosphere model.**
- **Event-Trigger variant of the Proposed Distributed Filter for Sensor Selection and Communication Channel Optimization based on the Cr√°mer-Rao Lower Bound and proportional Confidence Levels, that the user defines to balance the ratio between accuracy and communication optimization.**

<h3 align="left">Key Facts:</h3>

- **Satellite formation orbiting Earth in the different stages : (A) - Formation has both relative sensing between every satellite taken by each deputy and GPS measurements from the chief; (B) - Only relative-range being used by deputies; (C) - No measurements are being actuated and the formation graph only contains communication nodes between spacecraft.**

- **The Dynamics Model is made by the author w/ J2 and Drag ‚û°Ô∏è Model includes also the jacobians;**
- **Proposed Distributed Framework is easy to use and has, through testing with CubeSats from the SpaceX Transporter-1 mission, less memory transferred by factor of 1000 when compared to the current literature of distributed systems and 80% less sensor activations that the literature consensus-based distributed frameworks;**

- **All of this with on-par position error levels with the current literature alternatives in the V-R3x mission problem setting;**
